# MostWanted_JavaScript
# You have been contracted to build a prototype for a person-searching application for a top-secret government project. 
# You have been given access to an array of objects representing individuals. The prototype should just use window.prompt and window.alert for the User Interface (UI). 
# Although this isnâ€™t typical in production, you may use only three files for this project: an HTML file and two JavaScript files -- One JavaScript file for the 
# application and one JavaScript file containing the data for the application.

# ðŸ’¡ Do NOT change any code inside of the data.js file â€“ all of your code will be written inside of the app.js file!
